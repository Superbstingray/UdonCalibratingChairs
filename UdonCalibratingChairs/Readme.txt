v4.0  -  3/30/23  -  Made with UdonGraph: VRChat SDK - Worlds 3.1.11

Chairs that adjust their enter point to align avatars to a better sitting position. Includes a fix for VR users entering rotated stations and a proximity function so they are less likely to be entered accidentally.

v4.0 - Only interactable while within the trigger distance of the collider and only calibrates once the player is visible and within a set distance. This fixes calibration issues with the new avatar hiding feature.

(Usage)

Place prefab in scene and adjust position of chair to a location where you want there to be a seat.

Adjust the Knee Target GameObject to set where the player will be positioned. Ideally you should position this at the edge of chairs where you would expect the avatars knee to be.

Can align with chair models in your scene and then remove or disable the chair model in the prefab.
