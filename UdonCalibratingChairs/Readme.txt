v3.2 / v4.0  -  3/08/23  -  Made with UdonGraph: VRChat SDK - Worlds 3.1.11

Chairs that adjust their enter point to align avatars to a better sitting position. Includes a fix for VR users entering rotated stations and proximity functions so they are less likely to be used accidentally.

Sets the station seated position offset based on the position of the avatars knee.

Makes local and remote users check the users avatar knee position and sets the seated position offset to correct the players knee location to the defined Knee Target Position.

v4.0 - Only interactable while within the trigger distance of the collider and only calibrates when a user is looking at the station.

(Usage)

Place prefab in scene and adjust position of chair to a location where you want there to be a seat.

Adjust the Knee Target GameObject to set where the player will be positioned. Ideally you should position this at the edge of chairs where you would expect the avatars knee to be.

Can align with chair models in your scene and then remove or disable the chair model in the prefab.
